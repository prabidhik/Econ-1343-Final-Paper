% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
I exploit the differences in family member absentees caused by the foreign employement to estimate the effect of mother household headship on child vaccination rate. Using instrumental variable method and data from Nepal Social Inclusion Survey (NSIS) 2018, I find that there is no statistically significant affect on child vaccination rate if the household head is mother instead of father. Even after controlling for education, log wage, ethnicity, I do not find any significant effect in bacterial vaccination and viral vaccination.

% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
In low income countries, communicable disease is far more likely to be a cause of death than a noncommunicable disease. 6 of the top 10 causes of death remain such communicable diseases in low income countries, with Tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria all remaining in the top 10 (WHO, 2019). Thus, childhood vaccination is a crucial component of public health programs especially as a profound measure to reduce deaths from such diseases, notably in the developing countries like Nepal. According to Ministry of Health and Population, Nepal started providing BCG vaccine to all infants in free of cost (National Immunization Program) since 2005, pneumococcal vaccine since  2019, Oral Polio and DPT since 1979, Rubella in 2018. Despite this availability of free vaccines, the vaccinations coverage in Nepal is not yet full capacity, shown in the map of Nepal below in two categories: viral vaccination which includes Oral Polio, DPT, and Rubella and bacterial vaccine which includes BCG and Pneumococcal vaccine, with each 14 zones: the zone Karnali is not included because of lack of data, which puts children at a risk of preventable diseases. Previous researches have identified various factors that affects vaccination rates including socioeconomic conditions, maternal education, access to health care to mention few. However, the impact of maternal headship on vaccination rate has received less attention in the literature. This research aims to fill this gap by examining whether mother as a household head affects child vaccination rate in Nepal, using Nepal Inclusion Social Survey (NSIS) 2018. The findings of this study will provide insights into the role of household headship improving vaccination coverage and inform policies to promote child health care in Nepal.

% Literature Review
\section{Literature Review}
Vaccination is a pivotal preventive measure, particularly for the children, as it helps them protect them against several diseases. The World Health Organization estimates that the vaccination prevents approximately 2-3 million deaths per year. However, despite these proven efficacy of vaccines, there are still gaps in vaccination coverages in many parts of the world, specifically in low and middle income countries (Yousufzhai et. al, 2018). Nepal is one such country where vaccination rates are still low with only 77\% of children, as shown in the map above, aged 12-23 months having received all the vaccinations (Ministry of Health and Population, 2019).

The literature on the relationship between household headship and child health outcomes is mixed. Some studies suggest that having a female household headship is associated with a lower child vaccination rate due to socioeconomic status and limited access to health care services (Burgard \& reiman, 2006; Fulu et al., 2017, Sharma \& Reichenbach, 2018). 

In the context of Nepal, few studies have examined the relationship between the household headship and child vaccination rates. One study found that household with female headship were less likely to vaccinate their children due to lower education level and socioeconomic status (Kamiya et. al, 2017). However, this study did not control for other important factors that may have influenced vaccination rate such as access to health care and maternal-decision making power. Therefore, further research is necessary to understand the household headship and children vaccination rate in Nepal.

The NSIS data from 2018 provides us a unique opportunity to examine this relationship. The dataset includes detail information on household composition, socioeconomic status, and child health outcomes, absentee population allowing for the comprehensive analysis of the factors related with the child vaccination rate. By exploring the relationship between household headship and child vaccinations rate in Nepal, this research aims to provide valuable insights into the factors that affect child vaccination rate.


% Data 
\section{Data}
In my study, I use data from Nepal Social Inclusion Survey (NSIS) 2018. NSIS is a survey dataset which is conducted as a Study On Social Inclusion In Nepal (SOSIN) by Central Department of Anthropology, Tribhuwan University.  The dataset reports information on various socio-economc indicators of household and individuals in Nepal. It includes information on different characteristics within household information, health and social security, work and livelihood, language and education, social, cultural and gender relations, inclusive governance, women's empowerment and reproductive health.
The summary statistics of the final data that I used is given below:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{summary_statistcs.png}
    \caption{Table 1}
    \label{Table of Summary Statistics}
\end{figure}

I pooled the dataset from parent NSIS 2018 datasets which was further divided into sub datasets based on different demographic and economics sections. I merged the datasets which included the information that I required for this questions such as data on vaccinations, family income, education, ethnic groups and absentee population.
I then assigned 1 to each of BCG, Pneumococcal, Oral Polio, DPT/HEPB/HIB, Rubella if they had been given to their child else they else 0 was assigned. These vaccinations were further divided into bacterial vaccine and viral vaccine based on the characteristics of the cause of the disease that we are interested. They are further assigned 1 if each of bacterial or viral vaccines were administered else 0 was assigned. I also restrict the data to those families that had at least one absentee population. The absentee population is defined as anyone who is not present in the family because of foreign employment (within country or outside country) so that it can be used as an instrument. Families with missing information for any of the variables of our question were omitted. The final dataset has 337 observations out of which approximately 84\% were households with female head. \footnote{We have selected the families with at least one absentee population}. Table 1 summarizes the above dataset. We see that on average 95\% of the family had given the child full vaccinations for a bacterial disease and 88\% had given full vaccinations for viral disease.
% Methods
\section{Methods}
I use instrumental variable method to study the causal relationship between female household headship and child vaccination rate. The absentee population is defined as the instrument. In this paper, absentee population is defined as the member of the family who is away from home for the employment. I wish to estimate the following regression model:
\begin{align}
    y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \eta_i
\end{align}
In this regression, we are interested in $\beta_1$ as our coefficient of interest. But the problem is that there can be a problem of edogeneity as the error term is possibly correlated with our variable of independent variable. So, I come up with the first stage regression model:
\begin{align}
    x_i = \pi_0 + \pi z_i + \nu_i
\end{align}
where $\pi_0 + \pi z_i$ is the component of $x_i$ that is explained by $z_i$ while $\nu_i$ is the component that cannot be explained by $z_i$ and exhibits correlation with $\nu_i$.
where I have assumed that the following assumptions holds:\\
(i) Exogeneity: the absentee population is not related with the error term in equation (1).\\
(ii) Relevance: The household head being a female is correlated with the absentee population.
(iii) Exclusion restriction: the absentee population is not correlated with vaccination rate of the child. absentee population is correlated with child vaccination rate except through their effect on the endogenous variable of interest.\\
(iv) Monotonicity: The absentee does not have effect on the outcome variable other than through their effect on the endogenous variable of interest.\\
(v) Validity: The absentee population is not a subject to measurement error or other forms of bias.

Given that there is an absentee in the family (the dataset that we are interested in), male absentee consists massive 90.24 \% while female absentee consists only 9.76\%. So, in an overall data, male consists this [this much percentage.....] and female consists [this much...], and female household head is [this much.... ]. In our dataset female as a household consists [this much.......]. So it becomes obvious that when there is a absentee in a family, mother is most likely to be the head of the household. {this much percentage vaccination rate overall and when there is an absentee in the family, this much}. So, we can conclude that there is not much a correlation of being absentee to the child vaccination rate. We will be testing the limitations of these assumptions later, but we can argue that our instrument for the analysis is a valid instrument. The procedure of our instrumental variable method can be summarized in the figure below:

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{iv_model.001.jpeg}
    \caption{Use of instrumental variable}
    \label{Table of Summary Statistics}
\end{figure}

As our vaccination rate is further divided into viral vaccination rate and bacterial vaccination rate, I apply the same method and instrument in both the cases with outcome being either bacterial vaccination rate or viral vaccination rate.

The reduced form regression that I use is:

\begin{align}
    y_i = \mu_0 + \mu z_i + \theta_i
\end{align}


We then divide the beta coefficient obtained from the reduced form regression by the beta coefficient obtained from first stage regression to find the beta coefficient of interest. I controlled for potential confounding variables by including them as covariates in our regression model. Specifically, I included variables: log wage, education, social group, ethnic group to account for their potential effects on the outcome variable.
